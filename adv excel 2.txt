        Variable is a named memory location used to hold a value that can be changed during the script execution. 
Following are the basic rules for naming a variable.

You must use a letter as the first character.

You can't use a space, period (.), exclamation mark (!), or the characters @, &, $, # in the name.

Name can't exceed 255 characters in length.

You cannot use Visual Basic reserved keywords as variable name.
Data Types
There are many VBA data types, which can be divided into two main categories, namely numeric and non-numeric data types.

Numeric Data Types
Following table displays the numeric data types and the allowed range of values.

Type	Range of Values
Byte	0 to 255
Integer	-32,768 to 32,767
Long	-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,648
Single	
-3.402823E+38 to -1.401298E-45 for negative values

1.401298E-45 to 3.402823E+38 for positive values.

Double	
-1.79769313486232e+308 to -4.94065645841247E-324 for negative values

4.94065645841247E-324 to 1.79769313486232e+308 for positive values.

Currency	-922,337,203,685,477.5808 to 922,337,203,685,477.5807
Decimal	
+/- 79,228,162,514,264,337,593,543,950,335 if no decimal is use

+/- 7.9228162514264337593543950335 (28 decimal places).

Non-Numeric Data Types
Following table displays the non-numeric data types and the allowed range of values.

Type	Range of Values
String (fixed length)	1 to 65,400 characters
String (variable length)	0 to 2 billion characters
Date	January 1, 100 to December 31, 9999
Boolean	True or False
Object	Any embedded object
Variant (numeric)	Any value as large as double
Variant (text)	Same as variable-length string

Private Sub say_helloworld_Click()
   Dim password As String
   password = "Admin#1"

   Dim num As Integer
   num = 1234

   Dim BirthDay As Date
   BirthDay = DateValue("30 / 10 / 2020")

   MsgBox "Passowrd is " & password & Chr(10) & "Value of num is " & num & Chr(10) & "Value of Birthday is " & BirthDay
End Sub
                 
constant
          Constant is a named memory location used to hold a value that CANNOT be changed during the script execution. 
If a user tries to change a Constant value, the script execution ends up with an error. Constants are declared the same way 
the variables are declared.
Private Sub Constant_demo_Click() 
   Const MyInteger As Integer = 42 
   Const myDate As Date = #2/2/2020# 
   Const myDay As String = "Sunday" 
   
   MsgBox "Integer is " & MyInteger & Chr(10) & "myDate is " 
      & myDate & Chr(10) & "myDay is " & myDay  
End Sub

operators:-

An Operator can be defined using a simple expression - 4 + 5 is equal to 9. Here, 4 and 5 are called operands and
 + is called operator. VBA supports following types of operators −

Arithmetic Operators
Comparison Operators
Logical (or Relational) Operators
Concatenation Operators

Operator	Description	                                                     Example
+	Adds the two operands	                            A + B will give 15
-	Subtracts the second operand from the first	          A - B will give -5
*	Multiplies both the operands	                         A * B will give 50
/	Divides the numerator by the denominator	          B / A will give 2
%	Modulus operator and the remainder after an 
integer division	                                                                B % A will give 0
^	Exponentiation operator	                                 B ^ A will give 100000
The Comparison Operators
There are following comparison operators supported by VBA.

Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20, then −

=	Checks if the value of the two operands are equal or not. If yes, then the condition is true.	(A = B) is F
